<h1>About Me</h1>
My name is Andrew Granja. I was born in Miami FL and have spent most of my life living in Miami.
My family was originally from Cuba, but moved to Miami during the late 1950s. All my grandparents were born in Cuba and so was my father.
I got my high school education from Christopher Columbus High School in Miami and was part of the school's honor program.
I am currently enrolled at the University of Miami studying to get a Bachelors of Business Administration. I am also minoring in game design at the university.
