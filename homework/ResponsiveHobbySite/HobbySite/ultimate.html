<div class="ultimateinfo">
Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is the newest game in the Smash Brothers series
and is a very popular competitive esport. The scene is fairly new and is growing larger
and larger.

<header2>
  <div>Joker: Joker was the first DLC character of Ultimate and is in contention for the best
  character in the game due to his good combo game and buff gimmick. Joker
  has a meter next to his character portrait that when full allows him to gain buffs to his
  attack power and special moves. His base specials are Grappling Hook (up special), Eiha (side special),
  Rebel's Guard (down special), and Gun (nuetral special). His buffed specials are
  Wings of Rebellion (Up Special), Eihagon (side special), Tetrakarn/Makarakarn (down special),
  and Gun Special (neutral special). </div>

  <div>Peach: Peach is a difficult character to learn, but very rewarding.
  Very strong in competitive play, Peach is defined by her high percentage combos
  and fast gameplay. Her specials are Peach Parasol (up special), Peach Bomber (side special),
  Vegetable (down special), and Toad (neutral special). </div>

  <div>Pikachu: Also a very hard character to master, Pikachu could be considered the
  best character in the game. Pikachu's base hits don't do much damage, but its real talent
  are the combos it can perform. Its specials are Quick Attack (up special), Skull Bash
  (side special), Thunder (down special), and Thunder Jolt (neutral special).</div>

  <div>Pokemon Stadium 2: Without stage hazzards, this stage is very intersting.
    The platforms on each side of the stage can be used for combo potential or even
    early KO set ups for some characters. It's a very popular stage
    because of this!</div>
  </header2>
  <main>
  <div> <img src="imgs/TownandCity.jpeg" alt="Town" width="400"> </div>
</main>
<main2>
  <div>Town and City: A relatively basic stage, the main gimmick of this stage is a small platform
  which can appear from time to time allowing for combo potential for certain characters.
  Keep in mind the platform isn't reliable because if you're on it when it leaves,
  it'll head towards the blast zone. Make sure you get off it quickly before it
  reaches the blast zone!</div>
</main2>

  <div> <img src="imgs/Yoshi'sStory.png" alt="Yoshi's Story" width="400"> </div>
</footer>
<footer2>
  <div>Yoshi's Story: This stage returns from Melee with a few differences. Because
  Smash Ultimate allows for the players to turn off stage hazzards, the stage no longer has
  the tiny platform revolving around it. Instead, players make use of the walls of the stage to
  create opportunities for revovery.</div>
