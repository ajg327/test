the saiyans and was sent to Earth following the destruction of his planet. <strong>(Show More)</strong>

    Super Saiyan: Awakened against Frieza when Frieza killed Goku's best friend, the Super Saiyan transformation is

  </div>
  <div>
    Super Saiyan God: Super Saiyan God is unique in the sense that Goku couldn't attain it on his own. He needed the help of his
    friends to attain it. This form is many times stronger to normal Super Saiyan and allows Goku to use God Ki rather than normal energy.
    Goku's hairs and eyes become red and his body thins a bit allowing him to be faster than usual.
