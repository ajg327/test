<h2>Biography</h2>
<div> Goku is the protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. First appearing in chapter 1 of the original
manga, Goku has been a popular anime character since his creation in 1985. Originally a curious martial arts
prodigy as a child, as the series evolved it was revealed that Goku was a member of an alien species called
the saiyans and was sent to Earth following the destruction of his planet.

    Super Saiyan: Awakened against Frieza when Frieza killed Goku's best friend, the Super Saiyan transformation is
    one of Goku's ultimate techniques. Goku's energy and hair becomes gold while his eyes glow green. When in this form,

  <div>
    Super Saiyan God: Super Saiyan God is unique in the sense that Goku couldn't attain it on his own. He needed the help of his
    friends to attain it. This form is many times stronger than normal Super Saiyan and allows Goku to use God Ki rather than normal energy.
    Goku's hair and eyes become red and his body thins a bit allowing him to be faster than usual.
